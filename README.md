# RandomMath
Random math projects, with random stuff I made


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


mathPattern.py follows the collatz conjecture

Triangles.py is just a collection of various trignometry calculators, I used for homework. Using it at as backbone for something bigger.

Pascal Triangle was made for leetcode problem.

Vectors is also part of a bigger project but used the small part for homework.
