# RandomMath
Random math projects, with random math things I learnt


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


mathPattern.py follows this one math pattern where if you take any positive integer, if the number is even we divide by 2 if it is odd you multiply by 3 and add 1. Find a number that doesn't fit the pattern.


Triangles.py is just a collection of various trignometry calculators, I used for homework. Using it at a backbone for something bigger.

Pascal Triangle was made for leetcode problem.
